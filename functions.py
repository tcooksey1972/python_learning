#How to define a function using def keyword
#When?  When we have a group of code designed to perform a specific task
# Why? Functions are used when we combine code that is used together to perform a specific task
#Notice the code that defines the funcgtion is indented
#Python likes to use 4 spaces for intents
def say_hi(name, age):
    print("hello " + name+"!  You are "+ age)

say_hi("Tommy", "51")   #pass a name to your say_hi function



#calling our function.  Why?  Code inside of a function doesnt get executed by default
#say_hi()

#Order your output inserting your function

#print("Text above the function")
#say_hi()
#print("Text bellow the function")
