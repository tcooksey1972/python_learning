I wake up
If I'm hungry   #conditions that evaluate T or F
    I eat breakfast   #Action taken on true

I leave my house
if it's cloudy      #conditions that evaluate T or F
    I bring an umbrella  #Action taken on true
otherwise
    I bring sunglasses  #Action taken on false

I eat at a restaurant
if I want meat
    I order Steak
otherwise if I want post
    I order Spaghetti & meatballs
otherwise
    I order salad.
