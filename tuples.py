#Tuples are like list but immutable Below is a common tuple
#We use Tuples when data never is going to change
#If data will ever change we may want to consider using a list instead
coordinates = (4, 5)
# coordinates[1] = 10  #generate an error"helps prove immutablility of a tuple

print(coordinates[1]) #will print the second tuple that has been passed based on 0 index.
